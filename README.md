# YOU CAN DO IT!
We are more likely to achieve our goals when we have an accountability buddy.

This app is designed to share your goals with your friends so that they can act as an accountability buddy and help you achieve those goals!

Create an account, list your goals, add your friends, and see each other's goals. Click on the 'nudge' button next to your friend's goal to remind them to work on that goal.


# INSTALLATION
Create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv nameofvenv

Activate the virtual environment:

    source venv/bin/activate

I have included all the modules used in a file called "requirements.txt".
Please install it by running the following code:

    pip install -r requirements.txt    


# Future Improvements
Things I'd like to add:
- Ability to prioritise your goals
- A drop down menu to sort your goals by different parameters (ascending, descending, priority)
- Option to delete a friend
- Use JavaScript to incorporate notifications when someone nudges a goal
- Fix the code so that you cannot add the same friend more than once
